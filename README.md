# Amazon Product Recommendation System

In this project, we analyze Amazon product reviews to build a smart recommendation system. Our goal is to understand customer feedback, find useful product insights, and suggest the best products. Here’s how we’ll do it:

📊 Data Preparation: We load the dataset, which includes product details like names, categories, prices, ratings, and reviews. After cleaning the data, it’s ready for analysis.

🔎 Content-Based Filtering: We use product descriptions and reviews to find similar items using text analysis techniques.

🤝 Collaborative Filtering: We recommend products based on user ratings. If people with similar interests like a product, you might like it too!

⚡ Hybrid Approach: We combine both content-based and collaborative filtering for better recommendations.

📝 Text Analysis: We analyze reviews and descriptions to get deeper insights, helping improve product suggestions.
